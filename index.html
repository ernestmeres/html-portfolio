        <h2>Summary</h2>
        I am a trained Architect with over 12 years working experience in Architecture and Interior Design.
        I have recently taken the plunge into Web Design and Developement and I know I would be great at it.
        I took this career segue(if you can call it that) because I needed to challenge myself, show myself that I was capable of doing anytnhing I put my mind to.
        Also, the web developers seem to be making all the money.lol
